# Hi there! -

1. Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models for Image Classification of Fashion Items; code is in "ML Project", Report is in "Project Report". As this is a group project, I worked largely on the unsupervised learning sections of the project (MLP and Le-net5. Also helped with our modified version of Le-net5, Jo-net5) 


2. Exploring the Naive Bayes vs SVM classification approach for sentiment analysis in social media context; code is in "Final with CNN" and report is "Report" 

3. Clinic queue simulation is a small project done to simulate the queues of patients at a clinic and to figure out if there is a real need for addition of staff. 

4. Bunker Fraud was a project done in school with industry collaboration - to identify vessels with suspicious behavior using CBLOF, DBSCan and other methods.
