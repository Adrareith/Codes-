# Hi there! -

1. Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models for Image Classification of Fashion Items; code is in "ML Project", Report is in "Project Report". As this is a group project, I worked largely on the unsupervised learning sections of the project (MLP and Le-net5. Also helped with our modified version of Le-net5, Jo-net5) 


2. Exploring the Naive Bayes vs SVM classifcation approach for sentiment analysis in social media text; code is in "Final with CNN" and report is "Report"
